Grading Update:
- Shama'il Muhammadiyah: Successfully injected grades for 396 hadiths (98.5% coverage).
- Al-Adab Al-Mufrad: Scraped Sunnah.com but found NO grades. It appears Sunnah.com does not list grades for this book in English/Arabic interface explicitly (unlike Shamail or Bukhari).
- Musnad Ahmad: Skipped due to volume and complexity.
- Forty Nawawi: Already done.
- Hisn al-Muslim: Done via derivation.

Recommendation: For Al-Adab and Musnad, we may need a different data source (e.g. specialized JSONs) or just fallback to "Not Graded" in UI (which is current behavior).
